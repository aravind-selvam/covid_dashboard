# Covid_dashboard 
### Covid death and vaccine data.
In this project Iam exploring and visualizing Covid data using SQL and Tableau, as well as cleaning data with SQL. 
I will be storing the queries which I used for further exploration and viz's on the COVID data.

Data was downloaded from [LINK](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) Our world in data.org. This is a public dataset.

The queries are basic arithmetic in SQL to see the percent of the population that had been infected by Covid, 
as well as the death percentage for those infected.made use of the MAX() function to identify the locations where the percent of infection and death had been the highest, and the CAST() function to transform certain variables into integers. The SUM() function was used in order to explore some global statistics.
Temporary tables, table joins and window functions were also used.

My SQL queries posted here [LINK](https://github.com/aravind9722/Covid_dashboard/blob/main/Covid_data_analysis.sql)
